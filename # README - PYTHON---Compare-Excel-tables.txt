Hereâ€™s a Python script that compares two Excel tables and highlights the differences. The script uses the pandas library to read and compare the tables.

Compare Excel Tables

Answer in chat instead
Key Features of the Code:
Input:

Two Excel file paths.
Sheet names or indices for the sheets to compare.
An output file path to save the differences.
Comparison:

Checks if the column structures match between the two tables.
Uses pandas.DataFrame.compare to highlight differences.
Output:

Saves the comparison results in a new Excel file with a sheet named "Differences".
Dependencies:

Install the pandas and openpyxl libraries if not already installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas openpyxl xlsxwriter
Replace the file1, file2, and output_file paths with your actual file paths to test the script. ðŸš€ðŸ“Šâœ¨
